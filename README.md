# Operating Systems I - CSE UniWA Course 2024-2025
A brief showcase of the curriculum:

• **Introduction to operating systems** (definition, history, basic concepts, structure, layering, categories, etc.).  
• **Process communication and synchronization** (definition, race conditions, critical sections, mutual exclusion, locking mechanisms, queues, semaphores, monitors, etc.).  
• **CPU management** (scheduling requirements and criteria, process scheduling algorithms for batch processing systems and interactive systems, performance measures, etc.).  
• **Thread management** (differences between threads and processes, support of user-level and kernel-level threads, scheduling, synchronization and communication, libraries, etc.)  
• **Memory management** (swapping, physical memory organization, variable partitions, virtual memory, paging, segmentation, address translation, page replacement algorithms, hybrid schemes).  
• **Basic principles of input-output management** (device types, scheduling algorithms, etc.) and file systems.  
• **Case studies** (the support of the above concepts and mechanisms in modern operating systems such as Windows and Unix/linux).  

**Lab**:
Unix/Linux: installation, architecture, user commands, filters, shell programming, system
administration, basic security and protection mechanisms, writing and using simple and
complex scripts, programming with the awk language. Exercises simulating key concepts.
Introduction to the programming of concurrent processes (child processes, etc.).

In order to pass the course of OS1 (apart from the final exam), 2 Lab assignments had to be completed and submitted as well as a final lab exam.
The lab assignments together with the lab exam made up 30% of the total grade.

# Assignment 1
The first assignment teaches the most commonly used Linux commands, including Regular Expressions.
It had to be submitted in a single file with sufficient comments explaining the commands and RegEx used to answer the questions in the following format: 
(the first 3 written as comments for a CLI environment)
•Question  
•Explanation of the command(s) used  
•Command output  
•The command itself  

# Assignment 2
The second assignment requires 4 Bash scripts to be written by the students, with sufficient comments showcasing true understanding of the code.
